##About
Darwinism is a virtual ecosystem where organisms adapt to survive and are able to attack, breed, and interact with other organisms. The ecosystem holds the same amount of energy throughout the simulation and contains all levels of the food chain.

What happens in the simulation is a bunch of virtual organisms going around "eating" each other. The different colors denote different species so that green is plants, which is eaten by blue (bugs), which is eaten by red and yellow, which are eaten by Orange (apex predator). They lose energy when moving or by being attacked and gain energy when attacking. When they are close to another organism of their species, they might reproduce. The resulting organism has some of the characteristics of its parent organisms. This is when evolution comes into play:  better organisms survive long enough to pass on their characteristics, therefore resulting in a better gene pool.

##Upcoming
Most Organisms have simple AI right now (move towards food, breed if possible, run from attackers). Upcoming is more advanced and specific intelligence for each organism species.
